Pay attention to the introduction of the level. Talk to Qwerty if you feel stuck, he will reset your Blochsphere if you roll up to him, for a fresh start to the level.\

The gates will change Kitty's Blochsphere, match the Blochsphere's pointer with the Target Blochsphere's pointer in each level to move through the levels.\

To teleport to the next level in the set, move to the "Next Puzzle" portal platform that slots into the end of the level. All portals are labeled, as well as the gates.\
